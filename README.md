# ShoreshBot
Searching Hebrew words by their roots and patterns through a Telegram Bot using various dictionaries

My name is <a href="tg://user?id=6267602515">@shoresh_bot</a>, a bot for finding Hebrew words by their root.
I am somewhat similar to pealim.com, though a lot less huge and with a significantly smaller database of words.


I was created in May 2023 by <a href="tg://user?id=839506170">Misha Iomdin</a>, a 10th grader from Shimon Peres High Tech and Arts High school in Tel Aviv
(a.k.a. <a href="https://shevach-moffet.com/">Shevach Moffet</a>)
as a Hebrew project for the matriculation exam.


My amazing profile picture was created by Hannah Melnikovsky, Misha's classmate.


Feel free to <a href="tg://user?id=839506170">contact me</a> in case you have any ideas or questions!
